### Startup Command:

bin/dev (Do not use `rails s` directly, as it may cause js/css loading issues)

### The project uses the following tech stack:

Ruby on Rails 7.2
Tailwind v3
Figaro
PostgreSQL
Active Storage
Kaminari
Puma
RSpec
Stimulus + Turbo (Stream response, no Frame tags, no stream_from)
ActionCable( solid_queue, no redis )
FriendlyId

Do not add or remove any components and avoid upgrading or downgrading components.

**When users ask about deployment/architecture/environment setup** → Read `docs/project.md`

## What time you should run/stop project

Restarting project is unnecessary because Rails automatically hot-reloads code changes in most cases. Changes to the following explicitly require a restart:
- `config/` directory files (except `config/routes.rb`)
- `Gemfile`
- `config/application.yml`
- `config/appname.txt`

## MANDATORY PROJECT WORKFLOW - FOLLOW EXACTLY IN THIS ORDER

**STOP! Before creating ANY models or controllers, you MUST complete these steps first:**

### Step 1: REQUIRED - Update Application Name and Design System First
**ALWAYS start by updating the application name:** `echo "YourAppName" > config/appname.txt`

**ALWAYS start by updating existing design system variables in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`** (using `npm run build:css` to keep it right). DO NOT create any models/controllers before this.

**ALWAYS use HSL colors in application.css and tailwind.config.js**

If there are rgb colors in index.css, make sure to not use them in tailwind.config.js wrapped in hsl functions as this will create wrong colors

CRITICAL: USE SEMANTIC TOKENS FOR COLORS, GRADIENTS, FONTS, ETC. It's important you follow best practices. DO NOT use direct colors like text-white, text-black, bg-white, bg-black, etc. Everything must be themed via the design system defined in the `application.css` and `tailwind.config.js` files!

**NEVER use `@apply group` in CSS** - `group` class should only be added in HTML templates, not in CSS @apply directives.

**USE EXISTING COMPONENTS**: The system has complete .btn-*, .card-*, .alert-*, .badge-*, .form-* classes. Use these instead of creating new ones. See `application.css` header for full list. Custom components go in application.css bottom section. NEVER modify `components.css`.

Pay attention to contrast, color, and typography.

### Step 2: REQUIRED - Create Static Demo View
Create a static demo view at `app/views/shared/demo.html.erb`:
- **ONLY use**: HTML + Tailwind classes from design system
- **NO JavaScript**: No Stimulus controllers, no inline JS, no event handlers
- **NO backend**: No models, controllers, database, or dynamic data
- **Hardcoded content**: Use placeholder text and Unsplash images
- **Body only**: Write only body content (layout already exists)
- **Auto-routing**: System automatically renders this as homepage when home/index.html.erb doesn't exist

### Step 3: REQUIRED - Testing visit '/'
**ALWAYS run the project, then use `curl http://localhost:<PORT>/` to ensure these is no error**

### Step 4: Now You Can Create Models and Features
Only after completing Steps 1-3, you can NOW create ANY models and controllers. If you need authentication/payment/LLM features, check the generators section below.

### Step 5: MANDATORY - Before Task Completion
**CRITICAL: Run `rake test` and ensure ALL tests pass before delivering any feature**
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE - never deliver with failing tests
- Run multiple times until all tests pass (see Testing Requirements section)
- **If you are planning tasks with TodoWrite tool, ALWAYS include "Run rake test and ensure all tests pass" as a specific task item**


## Some important tips when Developing user authentication/payment/LLM-calling(AI APP) system

**Use These Generators (After Completing Steps 1-3):**

When developing features that require User or Order models, **DO NOT create them manually**. Use these generators instead:

1. **User Authentication System**: Use `rails generate authentication [--navbar-style=STYLE]` to generate User model and authentication system
   - **IMPORTANT**: Before running this generator, ensure NO User model exists
   - The generator creates: User model, migration, sessions, authentication logic, and user pages
   - **Navbar styles** (randomly selected if not specified): `classic`, `glass`, `floating`, `solid`, `transparent`
   - If User model already exists, remove it first to avoid conflicts

2. **Stripe Payment System**: Use `rails generate stripe_pay [--auth]` to generate polymorphic Payment model
   - **CRITICAL**: Generates Payment model (NOT Order) - Payment works with ANY business model via polymorphic association
   - Use `--auth` option to add user association (requires User model exists)
   - **Payment Model Pattern**:
     - Payment = Technical layer (handles Stripe integration, payment status)
     - Order/Subscription/Booking = Business layer (your domain logic)
     - Payment belongs_to :payable (polymorphic) - can attach to any model
   - **Generator creates**: Payment model, controller, service, partial views, admin interface
   - **You MUST create**: Your business model (Order/Subscription/etc), payment views (show.html.erb, success.html.erb)
   - **Example usage**: See `lib/generators/stripe_pay/USAGE` for complete examples

3. **LLM Integration:**: Use `rails generate llm` to generate LLM service infrastructure. Always prefer streaming via ActionCable - use `LlmStreamJob.perform_later(channel_name:, prompt:, system:)` for real-time streaming responses. Auto-configures LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_API_KEY, LLM_MODEL in application.yml. When storing LLM messages, include `LlmMessageValidationConcern` - don't validate role & content yourself.

Do not recreate administrator functionality in User model. Administrator system already exists. Adding admin page low priority.


## Some important tips when coding

**CRITICAL: Demo File Management**
- Demo shows good HTML structure and styling - CAN reference sections/layouts/Tailwind classes
- When creating home/index.html.erb: no placeholder links (`href="#"`), link to real static pages (create controller/view/route for Features, About, etc.) or use existing routes (sign_in_path, sign_up_path, etc.), use real database data

Do not generate any fake data that should originally be in the database for users.

Do not write any business logic in the admin backend that should only be for website management and maintenance.

Generate images using this placeholder website: https://images.unsplash.com/ and simultaneously verify accessibility with `curl` if you need static assets.

**ActiveStorage in Seeds**: When creating seed data for models with image attachments, Use unsplash image for pretty UI. Example: `Photo.create!(title: 'Demo', image: { io: URI.open('https://images.unsplash.com/xxx'), filename: 'photo.jpg' })`.

**Image Processing**: Prefer native ActiveStorage variants. If custom processing needed, use `ImageProcessing::Vips` only. Forbidden: MiniMagick, direct Vips::Image.

When installing any new gem or npm packages, always specify a version you are most familiar with and suitable for the project. Do not use the latest version directly.

**ALWAYS prefer `rails generate models` for batch model generation:**
- Syntax: `rails g models product name:string:default=Untitled price:decimal:default=0 + category name:string + tag name:string color:string:default=#000000`
- Separator: `+` splits different models
- Enhanced syntax support:
  - **Default values**: `field:type:default=value` (e.g., `status:string:default=draft`, `count:integer:default=0`)
  - **Serialize**: `field:text:serialize` (only for text/string; json/jsonb auto-handled)
- **Protected names**: Cannot use `user`, `order`, `payment`, etc. (suggests alternatives)

Use `rails generate model xxx` only when generating a single model (supports same enhanced syntax as above).

Use `rails generate service xxx` to generate a service file, not generate by yourself.

Use `rails generate admin_crud xxx` (where xxx is your model name that you created before) to create the initial CRUD when developing the admin management page, modify generated code for free.

Use `rails generate controller xxx [action1] [action2] [--auth] [--single]` (where xxx is your controller name, action is optional(all actions by default), --auth means need authenticate_user!, --single generates singular resource without index action) to create controllers when developing the user-side functionality, modify generated code for free.

Use `rails generate channel xxx [action1] [action2] [--auth]` to create ActionCable channels. Generates BOTH xxx_channel.rb (WebSocket) AND xxx_controller.ts (handles BOTH WebSocket AND UI interactions). Don't create separate controllers - extend the generated one. --auth adds authentication check in channel's subscribed method (reject unless current_user) - use for channels that require user authentication.

Use `rails generate pwa` to generate Progressive Web App setup with manifest, service worker, and install controller. Auto-detects app name from config.x.appname and theme color from application.css --color-primary.

Use `rails generate stimulus_controller xxx` to create new Stimulus controller, not generate by yourself.

** TURBO STREAM ARCHITECTURE - Mandatory Rules:**

**What is Turbo Stream?**
- Turbo Stream = Response format (render xxx.turbo_stream.erb) for partial DOM updates
- NOT `turbo_stream_from` in views (we don't use this pattern)
- NOT `<turbo-frame>` tags (we don't use Frame feature)

**Frontend (Stimulus):**
- NO `fetch()` - breaks Turbo Drive, requires manual DOM updates
- NO `preventDefault() + requestSubmit()` - preventDefault blocks submission
- Stimulus for UI only (toggle, show/hide) - NOT for data submission

**Backend (Controllers):**
- Prefer HTML: Render normal HTML views by default
- Use Turbo Stream when needed: For partial updates, create `action.turbo_stream.erb` templates
- NO `respond_to` blocks - unnecessary branching
- NO `format.html/json/xml` - violates architecture
- NO `render json:` - JSON data passing is disabled (API namespace `app/controllers/api/` exempt)
- NO `head :ok` - frontend cannot determine UI updates

**ActionCable Channel Pattern:**
- Frontend calls backend: `this.perform('methodName', {params})`
- Backend receives: Define `def methodName(data)` in channel
- Backend broadcasts: `ActionCable.server.broadcast(channel, {type: 'event-name', data: {}})`
- Type-based routing: Frontend defines `handleEventName(data)` method, backend triggers it via `type: 'event-name'`
- NO manual message parsing - the routing happens automatically

** ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE**:
- Three validators enforce project architecture (run via `rake test`, never skip):
  - `spec/javascript/stimulus_validation_spec.rb` - Stimulus controller-view integration
  - `spec/javascript/turbo_architecture_validation_spec.rb` - Turbo Stream patterns
  - `spec/javascript/project_conventions_validation_spec.rb` - Project conventions
- ALL validator errors are REAL violations - fix them immediately, NEVER dismiss as false positives
- Failures mean broken functionality or architecture violations

Use FriendlyId (already configured) if need slug URLs. For user-facing content use `friendly_id :title, use: :slugged`, for admin/API use simple IDs.

Never write nested form.

## FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT RULES - STIMULUS + TURBO + TYPESCRIPT

**MANDATORY**: ALL frontend interactions MUST use Stimulus controllers (read controller header comments first, never guess target/value/action names). NO inline JavaScript, jQuery, or pure JavaScript allowed. ALWAYS prefer TailwindCSS v3 for styling.

**Icons**: NEVER use emojis. Use Lucide icons: `<%= lucide_icon "icon-name", class: "w-5 h-5" %>`.

## Testing Requirements

**MANDATORY**:
- View/Controller changes: `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/xxx_spec.rb` must pass
- Major changes or before delivery: Run full `rake test` to ensure stability

`rake test` is configured to only show 5 failed test cases at a time, so you should repeatedly run rake test if these have errors (no more than 10 rounds) until all tests pass

For authenticated curl: `rails dev:token[test@example.com]` outputs the token and example curl command (will create user if not exists). Copy the token and use it:
```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' http://localhost:<PORT>/your_endpoint
```

Do not use `rails console`, use `rails runner` instead if you want insert or check db data.

Use `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/xxx_spec.rb --format documentation`( not -v or --version ) for single test.

**When you see "Views for xxx are not yet developed" error during testing, immediately create the corresponding view file, then re-run the tests.**

Temporary files should be written in the `tmp` directory.

## Debugging Frontend Errors

**Frontend Error Report Protocol:**
1. **Read logs FIRST** - Don't guess, check Run project output and stack traces
2. **Identify root cause** - What action triggered it? What's the actual error?
3. **Minimal fix** - Fix only what's broken based on logs
4. **Test** - Verify the exact scenario that failed

## Code Quality

**FAIL FAST PRINCIPLE:**
- NEVER use default values to hide missing required data
- Let functions return `nil` or raise errors when data is missing
- Validate inputs early and explicitly
- Avoid "silent failures" that mask bugs

**CODE COMMENTS:**
- Minimal comments, focus on self-documenting code
- English only, explain WHY not WHAT
- No obvious comments that repeat the code

## Some files never edit

Never edit `application.html.erb`, `admin/base_controller.rb`, `clipboard_controller.ts`, `dropdown_controller.ts`, `theme_controller.ts`.
